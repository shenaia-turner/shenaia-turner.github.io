            <h2>BOX-LAMINATIONS</h2>
            <p>The objective of BOX-LAMINATIONS is to use the properties of different woods and the affordances of digital fabrication as design and form generators. The model of our wood is split into strips and irregular pieces were grouped from single and double curved shapes to separate the more planar pieces from the curvy pieces.</p>

            <h2>AIRFORMATICS</h2>
            <p>This project is a collaborative research undertaken during a one-semester, 16-week studio at the University of Pennsylvania as part of the Master of Science and Design in Robotics and Autonomous Systems program. We asked the question: Could the inflation of thermoplastic preforms be a suitable manufacturing method to create thin-walled high-volume architectural components? To address this, an automated manufacturing approach aimed at enhancing scale and inflation formation for the Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) based production is used in combination with an inflation simulation scenario and a custom end-of-arm tool for inflation.</p>

            <h2>OFF / FROM THE WALL</h2>
            <p>Using both PolyCam and RealityScan, we captured an areaâ€™s point cloud using a series of stitched together images. We focused on the Corbel and its ornamental pattern, materiality, and primordial shape, as well as its out-of-placeness. Using photogrammetry, we were able to retrieve a 3D model of the site, extract the Corbel, and generate a form. To get our final geometry, we first ran an aggregation script from Grasshopper with Python and generated it with a solid rectangle. Then, between some of the generated corbels, we lofted to create connections between them, generating the foam pieces. We used Google Colab to convert our image into canny edge representations and added it to our mass as a tattoo.</p>
